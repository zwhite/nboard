action.cgi:
	Implement functionality for enabling and disabling notifications
	globally and for contacts.

hostrrd.cgi:
	Fetch the graph.pm from the remote eluna installation and parse it
	for our purposes. No reason we can't leverage what they're already
	doing, and it'd make specifying graphs easier.

iphone.cgi:
	Make this more AJAXy. It takes a while to fetch and render the current
	output, especially over EDGE. Should only return the overview pages 
	maybe the groups, and fetch the rest on demand.

reports/nagiosreport.py:
	This should check some more things. Which hosts have notifications
	disabled. Has anything gone unacknowledged for more than N hours.

main.js:
	Write function to handle enabling and disabling notifications for
	contacts, as used by contacts.py.
